# Bob's Astro Integration Update - 2025-08-05

## Summary
Karl requested implementation of new payment flow for Adam's Astro website, replacing old Astro payment system (useasterisk.com) integration.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Created New Endpoint
- **File**: `src/app/api/create-paid-invoice/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Receives order data from payment server after successful payment
- **Security**: API key validation using same key as payment server
- **Functionality**:
  - Creates invoice with status "paid" immediately
  - Generates invoice number (INV-YYYYMM-XXX)
  - Calculates GST (1/11th of GST-inclusive price)
  - **ActiveCampaign is now MANUAL ONLY** (triggered by humans day before delivery)
  - **Google Sheets sync is now MANUAL ONLY** (removed automatic sync)

### 2. Removed Old Astro Docs
- Deleted: `docs/ASTRO-INTEGRATION.md`
- Deleted: `docs/ASTRO-INTEGRATION-SUMMARY.md`
- Deleted: `docs/ASTRO-INTEGRATION-SECURITY-REVIEW.md`

### 3. Updated Coordination Log
- Updated `../ausbeds-docs/BOB-KIM-COORDINATION.md`
- Informed Kim about completed endpoint
- Ready for integration with payment server

## New Payment Flow
1. Adam's Astro website â†’ collects payment with Stripe Elements
2. Payment server â†’ processes payment
3. On success â†’ calls our `/api/create-paid-invoice`
4. We create paid invoice â†’ trigger all integrations
